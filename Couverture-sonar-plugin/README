Overview:- 

         Couverture Tool calculates code coverage specific to the user stories we deliver.
         This gives a clear picture in terms of percentage of code coverage for each user story.
         And hence coverage result does not get diluted with usually low legacy code coverage or other user stories coverage.   

Support the Tool with your Project and follow the below steps:
        
         1. Make sure your project implement Jacoco or Cobertura and create Jacoco.xml or cobertura’s coverage.xml
         
         2. Pre generate jacoco.xml or coverage.xml for your project
         
         3. Tool is available as a Plugin to SonarQube. To generate sonar report with Couverture tool follow these steps :

                  * Place USSC-plugin jar at sonarqube-X.X.X/extensions/plugins

                  * Start SonarQube server

                  * Add it as widget to dashboard in sonar. At start of sprint, configure plugin with list of user stories in sprint scope.

                  * Generate sonar report for your project with follwing command :
                    mvn sonar:sonar
        
         4. If you are getting such type of error when you run mvn sonar:sonar command, then you need to install collabnet subversion software.
            You can download the software from the following link:-     https://www.collab.net/downloads

         5: If you getting such type of error during sonar runner analysis, the SVN command is executed many times. Sometimes this error happens: "The connection might be lost for a moment so that a timeout occurs and the SVN server can't be reached".
             How to solve : please go to administration in sonar. and click on scm and set a scm properties scm=true.
